## Checkpoint

### [Double Ce Boost](https://youtu.be/t32Djfbqi70)
[Ce boost](http://localhost:8080/guides/speedrun-tech.html#ce-boost-core-eject-boost) through red doors as they open, slam when you reach the door, dash slide through, then [Ce boost](http://localhost:8080/guides/speedrun-tech.html#ce-boost-core-eject-boost) over the lava, when you land, [slide jump](http://localhost:8080/guides/speedrun-tech.html#slide-jump) and wait until the boss door starts to open before checkpointing so that the boss will do the fast spawn animation
### [Lava Hall UB](https://youtu.be/7KOZgVpFU9k)
Using a lineup (or eyeballing it), UB to bonk onto the ceiling and then perfectly go straight into the door, then slide or slide jump to hit the checkpoint, and then make sure the boss entrance door slightly opens the checkpoint.<br />
This part needs to be rewritten

## Boss Kill
### [Simple Variation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB-7rGVHKnU)
[Dsj](http://localhost:8080/guides/speedrun-tech.html#dsj-dash-slide-jump) into the room, place a saw trap with 8 blue saws and an overheat saw, using multiple magnets so it hits where both Cerberi will spawn.<br />
First Cerberus:<br />
Jumpstart, then charge up and shoot the alt fire on the slab sharpshooter. Fire a rocket then charge red jackhammer primary and alt fire. [Whip cancel](http://localhost:8080/guides/speedrun-tech.html#whip-cancel) to the Cerberus and release both primary and alt fire. If the Cerberus’s first attack is a dash you will have to dash to the side first in order to whip cancel to it. <br />
[Cerb Dash Version](https://youtu.be/oB-7rGVHKnU)<br />
Second Cerberus:<br />
[Railcoin](http://localhost:8080/guides/speedrun-tech.html#railcoins) it with 1 coin then [srs combo](http://localhost:8080/guides/speedrun-tech.html#srs-combo)<br />
Exit: During hitstop from the second Cerberus dying start charging the green shotgun. Count four pumps, then [slam store](http://localhost:8080/guides/speedrun-tech.html#slam-store) on the door and [dive](http://localhost:8080/guides/speedrun-tech.html#dives), then look down and over pump. Slam once near the exit, put oil on the ground and slide into the exit, use [slideways](http://localhost:8080/guides/speedrun-tech.html#slideways) for extra speed. Ideally you want to slam on the stairs and not the flat part of the ground.<br />
### [Intermediate Variation](https://youtu.be/KGV218RLHEo)
[Dsj](http://localhost:8080/guides/speedrun-tech.html#dsj-dash-slide-jump) into the room, place a saw trap with 8 blue saws and an overheat saw that can hit where the first Cerberus spawns <br />
First Cerberus:<br />
Equip red jackhammer, go near where the second Cerberus spawns, charge the primary and secondary fire on the jackhammer. Time a dash jump toward the first Cerberus to hit it with the jackhammer as soon as it is vulnerable. During the jackhammer hitstop, jumpstart Cerberus. This should reduce it down to less than half HP, triggering the second Cerberus spawn.<br />
Second Cerberus:<br />
Once you’re out of hitstop, start placing frozen rockets on top of where the second Cerberus will spawn and parry the first Cerberus’s apple throw. After placing 3 rockets the second Cerberus will spawn, [SRS combo](http://localhost:8080/guides/speedrun-tech.html#srs-combo) it as soon as it spawns and aim it so it will hit the first Cerberus to make sure it dies.<br />
Note: If your rockets are exploding while you are trying to parry, stop placing rockets, parry, then continue placing rockets.<br />
### [Harder Intermediate Variation](https://youtu.be/KGV218RLHEo&t=13s)
Similar to the Intermediate variation, however, once you’ve placed all your saws, freeze and place a rocket where the second cerberus would spawn, then quickly swap to jackhammer and proceed with the intermediate kill, except with 4 rockets instead of 3. Once you’ve placed your 4 rockets, dismount them and then [SRS combo](http://localhost:8080/guides/speedrun-tech.html#srs-combo) the first cerb so it dies, then once the second cerb dies it should be instantly killed because of the 4 rockets.
