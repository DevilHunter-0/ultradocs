## Boss Kill:
### [Beginner Kill](https://youtu.be/NuyWS2TPZNc)
From checkpoint dash, fire the overheat saw, then dash jump and pump green shotgun twice <br />
Which attack swordsmachine does is based on your distance from the boss and you want the standing swing, so stand close to where it spawns<br />
Shotgun parry swordsmachine <br />
Jump and throw a coin straight down, then [punch](http://localhost:8080/guides/speedrun-tech.html#coin-punch) it<br />
Punch it 2 more times while pumping green shotgun twice<br />
Shoot swordsmachine with the shotgun<br />
Punch once more while charging slab piercer<br />

### [Dram Kill](https://youtu.be/qv7w8ds2ejs)
From checkpoint dash, fire the overheat saw, then dash jump and fire a coin down, pump green shotgun twice then [punch](http://localhost:8080/guides/speedrun-tech.html#coin-punch) the coin right before it hits the ground <br />
Which attack swordsmachine does is based on your distance from the boss and you want the standing swing, so stand close to where it spawns<br />
As soon as swordsmachine spawns, punch the coin then shotgun parry swordsmachine<br />
Start charging slab piercer while punching the coin then fire the charge shot up through swordsmachine into the coin<br />
Throw a new coin straight down so the piercer chains to it, then [whiplash the coin](http://localhost:8080/guides/speedrun-tech.html#ricostacks)<br />

Shoot the revolver at the coin immediately after punching it<br />
