# 1-1 // HEART OF THE SUNRISE (Any%)
## [Untagged Wall Clip](https://youtu.be/ddrVnvt-kRI)
[Slam store](/guides/speedrun-tech.md#slam-store) in the entrance pipe, slide jump, then [slide jump](/guides/speedrun-tech.md#slide-jump) slightly to the left to curve around the cerberus statue. <br />
Slide under the tree. <br />
Place a frozen rocket against the wall between the fallen pillar and the door, facing straight down <br />
Jump and slam to mount the rocket <br />
Slam off the rocket and [flick ub](/guides/speedrun-tech.md#flick-ub) to the checkpoint <br />
## [Arena Clear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu3sgrrz6Ic)
Dash jump then [slide jump](/guides/speedrun-tech.md#slide-jump) to reach the arena<br />
Place 3 magnets on the red door <br />
Whiplash and jumpstart one of the strays, fire some nails into it, then knuckleblast it <br />
To make sure jumpstart kills everything, throw some extra coins <br />
Stand in the center of the room facing straight up, and [nuke](/guides/speedrun-tech.md#nukes) when the drones spawn <br />
For reasons I canâ€™t explain, delaying the nuke slightly makes the nuke kill all the drones more consistently <br />
