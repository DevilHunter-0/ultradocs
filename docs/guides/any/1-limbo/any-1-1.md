## [Untagged Wall Clip](https://youtu.be/ddrVnvt-kRI)
Slam store in the entrance pipe, slide jump, then slide jump slightly to the left to curve around the cerberus statue. <br />
Slide under the tree. <br />
Place a frozen rocket against the wall between the fallen pillar and the door, facing straight down <br />
Jump and slam to mount the rocket <br />
Slam off the rocket and ultraboost to the checkpoint <br />
## [Arena Clear](https://youtu.be/ddrVnvt-kRI)
Dash jump then slide jump to reach the arena<br />
Place a magnet on the bottom center of the red door with one overheat saw <br />
Whiplash and jumpstart one of the strays, fire some nails into it, then knuckleblast it <br />
To make sure jumpstart kills everything, throw some extra coins <br />
Stand in the center of the room facing straight up, and nuke when the drones spawn <br />
For reasons I canâ€™t explain, delaying the nuke slightly makes the nuke kill all the drones more consistently <br />
Slam store exit
