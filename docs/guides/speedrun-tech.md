# Speedrun Tech

## Base Movement:
### Slide and Slam Momentum Mechanics
Sliding preserves any momentum you had prior to the slide, this momentum will be slowly lost  while sliding on the ground <br />
Jumping or sliding after a slam grants additional jump height or slide speed depending on how long you were slamming <br />
### Slide Jump
Jumping during a slide carries the slide momentum into the jump and amplifies it <br />
### Dash Slide Jump
Dash then slide and then jump, basically a dash jump for 1 stamina <br />
Slam Store
Interrupting a slam with a wall jump stores the slam state without the downward speed, allows reaching max slam momentum quickly <br />
### Dives
Jump and then slide almost at the same time, slide jump that gives more height, gains both horizontal and vertical speed from slam momentum
### Slideways
Holding sideways while sliding sideways increases your horizontal speed by 5 unitsWall Bounces/
### Wounces
Wall Jumping while in a slide reverses and preserves your momentum
### Super Slide Jump/Ssj
After letting go of slide there is a 3 frame window(assuming 120 fps) where pressing jump will do a <br />
slide jump that adds either 24, 12 or 6 units to your speed depending on which of the frames you jump in <br />
Entering the command “prefs set bool ssjIndicator true” into console (opened by pressing tilda) will tell you when you successfully ssj
### Dive Super Slide Jump/Dive Ssj
	
### Wall Super Slide Jump/Wall Ssj
	
### Whip cancel
Punching or whiplashing during whiplash will cancel it, this can be used to make green hook points function as blue ones
### Whip slamming
Slamming during a whiplash will not give downward speed but does build slam momentum
## Weapon Movement Tech:
### Core Eject Boost/Ce Boost
Tap slide and fire a core eject down at the same time, gives high vertical speed 
### Ultraboost/Ub
Malicious Rail a core eject, fastest method of movement in the game
### Flick Ultraboost/Flick Ub
A faster method of ultra boosting that can be done in the air, fire a core and dash at the same time, turn the camera 180 degrees, then malicious rail
### Checkpoint Ub/Chub
Ultraboost, then checkpoint as you take damage from it, gives you momentum after respawning <br /> 
this is significantly easier to do on 120 fps
### Frozen Unfriendly Pull-it/Fup
Fire a rocket then whiplash it, fast explosion boost that can be done midair
### Floor Frozen Unfriendly Pull-it/Floor fup
With freezeframe active while looking down, fire a rocket then whiplash it, launches straight up if not holding directional keys, otherwise launches in the direction you are moving
### Oil
Sliding on oil perfectly preserves momentum
### Instant Rocket Ride
Activate freezeframe shoot a rocket, jump, then slam, works while grounded or to swap to a new rocket while already rocket riding <br />
Activate freezeframe, look very slightly down, then shoot and dash at the same time wait slightly then unfreeze, allows rocket riding quickly while mid air
### Core Snipe Boosts
Fire a core eject in front of you, shoot it with the revolver then dash through it, you will get hit by the lasting hitbox and launched, the height of the core when you shoot it is very lenient
### Duck Boosting
Shotgun primary fire pushes you forward slightly, can be used with shotgun swapping
### Biercer
Holding left click while charging a piercer shot will fire it the instant it full charges
## Combat Tech List:
### Shotgun Swapping 
Swapping between shotguns after each shot skips most of the cooldown
### Projectile Boost
Punching with feedbacker as you fire the shotgun causes a pellet to explode on impact
### Nukes
Firing a malicious rail at a core eject creates a very large high damage explosion
### Core Snipes
Firing a revolver at a core eject creates a large red explosion
### Over Pump Dodge
The blast from a fully charged green shotgun can be dodged
### Frozen Unfriendly Pull-it/Fup
Whiplash a rocket then freeze it, you need to be in the air when the rocket reaches you,  creates a <br />
large red explosion at the cost of 35 hp
### Flayer Instas
Hitting a mindflayer with an explosion as it does the blue orbs attack will reflect the back at it, killing the mindflayer instantly, overpumps and nukes have a lasting explosion making the timing more lenient
### SRS Combo
At point blank fire a cannonball then punch with feedbacker slightly after, quick high damage, one taps virtues, cerberi, and sentries. <br />
If you get the +CANNONBOOST style bonus, you punched too soon. <br />
You only need to charge srs cannon to 25% for full damage.
### Jackhammer whip cancel
Whip canceling instantly grants max jackhammer damage
### Conduction in water
Jumpstart and electric rail automatically trigger conduction while underwater with far greater 
range and self damage if you are touching the water
### Rocket Traps
Placing a frozen rocket where an enemy spawns will create a large red explosion, this works 
whether or not the rocket has had time to supercharge due to enemies spawning slightly off and the ground
### Knuckleblast Cooldown Cancel
Pressing swap arm or whiplash will cancel the cooldown from a knuckleblaster shockwave
### Overheat Quick Charge
Firing one blue saw fully charges the heat on the green sawblade
## Coin Tech:
### Split coins
Shooting a coin with the default revolver during the flash at the peak of its ark or after it has started making a humming sound while falling will cause it to turn into two hitscans, 
### Coin Punching
Punching a coin with the feedbacker at any point after the flash will send the coin into the nearest enemy or wherever you are facing and make it bounce back into the air with a damage increase, its damage caps after punching it into a surface 3 times
### Dead coins
Shooting a coin and immediately after firing a new coin will transfer the damage to the new coin and increase it, allowing you to bypass the damage cap on coin punching
### Double Dead Coin
Firing multiple coins then shooting and firing a new coin will transfer all the damage of the coins to the new one, this requires delaying firing the new coin slightly more than with only one coin
### Slab Coins
Slab Piercer charge shot does incredibly high damage when shooting a coin
### Railcoins 
Throw a coin through an enemy then fire electric rail this will cause the rail to hit the enemy then chain of the coin to hit it again
Quickly swapping back to the marksman allows adding more coins after the rail is shot
### Ricostacks
If multiple hitscans hit a coin at the same time while in hitstop, they will both ricochet off the coin, the same applies to a hitscan and a feedbacker punch or whiplash, this will also allow reusing the coin
### Sludge


## Types of Oobs/Skips:
### Untagged wall clip
Certain walls are untagged and thus will not correct where the rocket launcher places you when mounting a rocket, allowing you to teleport through them
Untagged walls can recognized by whiplashing them, if the whiplash passes through it, it is untagged
### Victoria Clip
Certain walls, primarily in the violence layer are thinner, and don’t destroy frozen rockets that are placed in them, getting on a rocket that is in this state will clip the camera out of bounds, from on the rocket looking down at about a 45 degree angle, then shooting a rocket, tapping whiplash and jump at the same time will clip you out
### Tight Space Clips
Certain gaps in geometry that the player can’t normally fit through can be moved through by 
mounting a rocket
### Slide Clips
Certain gaps in geometry that the player can’t normally fit through can be moved through by spamming slide, these clips are generally more consistent the higher your frame rate and the faster you mash slide
### Trigger Skip
Some enemy spawn triggers are incredibly thin, and can be skipping by mounting a rocket that is 
placed precisely due to mounting a rocket teleporting you slightly
### Arch Clips
### Skuggle

## Level Exits:
### CE Boost exit
Core eject boost as the red door opens, place oil, slide jump, and slam
### Slam store exit
Slam store off of the exit door, place oil, slide and turn sideways holding in the direction you are moving, then slam into the exit
### Ub exit
Put your back to the exit door and ultraboost as the door opens, then quickly turn around and place oil, then slam into the exit <br />
or <br />
Stand slightly back from the door, as it opens flick ub, then place oil, then slam into the exit 
### Sandwich exit
### Dash Extension Exit
