# Other Info

## Please read the src rules before submitting runs
The moderators would really apreciate it

## Difficulty
Leaderboards for ultrakill are not sorted by difficulty <br/>
The majority of runs are done on violent difficulty. This is to make filth group up faster and to make flayer instas and parry able attacks faster. Some boss animations are also faster on violent such as V2 and corpse of king minos. <br/>
Runs that don't have any enemies are usually done on harmless for more hp and faster stamina regen, this includes no monsters runs and some individual level runs. <br/>
Occasionally runs are done on brutal for even faster enemies, however most runs will not be on brutal due to higher health bosses, and jumping filth making them more incosistent to kill. <br/>
If difficulty has zero impact on a run, some runners will run on lenient as a joke. <br/>
 
## Weapon order
Marksman on 1, core eject on 1, attractor or jumpstart on 1, malicious rail on 1, freezeframe or firestarter on 1. <br/>
Order for second and third slots don't really matter.

## Controls
Using hotkeys for each weapon is highly reccomended. <br/>
Seperate arms binds is not required but recomended. <br/>
Use either variation 3 or previous variation, currently previous variation does input on release so variation 3 is better. <br/>
Having 2 slide buttons can be helpful for slide clips if you aren't great at mashing. <br/>

## Livesplit
The timer program used in multi level runs is livesplit. Which you can get [here](https://livesplit.org/). Note that due to livesplit not timing to the thousanths place it can't be used for submission times, you instead have to manually add up the times from the level end screen. There is a excell spreadsheet in the resources tab on speedrun.com to help with this.
