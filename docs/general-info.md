## Difficulty
Leaderboards for ultrakill are not sorted by difficulty <br/>
The majority of runs are done on VIOLENT difficulty. This is to make enemies move and attack faster leading to things like filth grouping up faster and cause mindflayer's instas and parry-able attacks happen faster. Some boss death animations are also faster on Violent such as V2 and The Corpse of King Minos. <br/>
Runs that don't have any enemies are usually done on harmless for more hp and faster stamina regen, this includes No Monsters (NoMo) runs and some individual level runs. <br/>
Occasionally runs are done on brutal for even faster enemies, however most runs will not be on brutal due to higher health bosses, and jumping filth making them more incosistent to kill. <br/>
If difficulty has zero impact on a run, some runners will run on lenient as a joke. <br/>
 
## Controls
Using hotkeys for each weapon is highly reccomended. <br/>
Seperate arms binds is not required, but recomended. <br/>
Using either variation 3 or previous variation is highly recommended. Currently, previous variation does input on release so variation 3 is better. <br/>
Having 2 slide buttons can be helpful for slide clips, allowing you to mash faster and easier <br/>

## LiveSplit
The timer program used in multi-level runs is LiveSplit. Which you can get [here](https://livesplit.org/). Note that due to LiveSplit not timing to the thousanths place it can't be used for submission times, you instead have to manually add up the times from the level end screen. There is a excell spreadsheet in the resources tab on speedrun.com to help with this.
