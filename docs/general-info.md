## Difficulty

Leaderboards for ULTRAKILL are not sorted by difficulty.

- The majority of runs are done on **VIOLENT** difficulty. This makes enemies move and attack faster, leading to things like filth grouping faster and Mindflayer's instas and parryable attacks occurring earlier. Some boss death animations are faster on Violent, such as V2 and The Corpse of King Minos.<br/>

- Runs without enemies (such as No Monsters (NoMo) runs and some individual level runs) are usually done on **Harmless** for more HP and faster stamina regen.<br/>

- Occasionally, runs are done on **Brutal** for even faster enemies. However, most runs avoid Brutal due to higher boss health and more inconsistent Filth kills caused by their increased jumping.<br/>

- If difficulty has no impact on a run, some runners will run on **Lenient** as a joke.

 
## Controls

- Using hotkeys for each weapon is highly recommended to improve reaction time and efficiency.<br/>

- Separate arm binds are not required but recommended.<br/>

- Using either **Variation 3** or the previous input variation is strongly suggested. Previous variation is input on release, so Variation 3 is considered better.<br/>

- Having two slide buttons can help with slide clips, allowing you to mash faster and easier.


## LiveSplit

The timer program used in multi-level runs is LiveSplit. Which you can get [here](https://livesplit.org/). Note that due to LiveSplit not timing to the thousandths place it can't be used for submission times, you instead have to manually add up the times from the level end screen. There is an Excell spreadsheet in the resources tab on speedrun.com to help with this.
