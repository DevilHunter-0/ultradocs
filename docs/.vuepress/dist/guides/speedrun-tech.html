Movement: Slide and Slam Momentum Mechanics Sliding preserves any momentum you had prior to the slide, this momentum will be slowly lost while sliding on the ground Jumping or sliding after a slam grants additional jump height or slide speed based on how long you were slamming Slide Jump Jumping during a slide carries the slide momentum into the jump and amplifies it Dash Slide Jump Dash then slide and then jump, basically a dash jump for 1 stamina Slam Store Interrupting a slam with a wall jump stores the slam state without the downward speed, allows reaching max slam momentum quickly Dives Jump and then slide almost at the same time, slide jump that gives more height, gains both horizontal and vertical speed from slam momentum Slideways Holding sideways while sliding sideways increases your horizontal speed by 5 units Wall Bounces/Wounces Wall Jumping while in a slide reverses and preserves your momentum Super Slide Jump/Ssj After letting go of slide there is a 3 frame window(assuming 120 fps) where pressing jump will do a slide jump that adds either 24, 12 or 6 units to your speed depending on which of the frames you jump in Entering the command “prefs set bool ssjIndicator true” into console opened by pressing tilda, will tell you when you successfully do an ssj Dive Super Slide Jump/Dive Ssj</p><p>Wall Super Slide Jump/Wall Ssj</p><p>Whip cancel Punching or whiplashing during whiplash will cancel it, this can be used to make green hook points function as blue ones Whip slamming Slamming during a whiplash will not give downward speed but does build slam momentum</p><p>Weapon Movement Tech: Core Eject Boost/Ce Boost Tap slide and fire a core eject down at the same time, gives high vertical speed Ultraboost/Ub Malicious Rail a core eject, fastest method of movement in the game Flick Ultraboost/Flick Ub A faster method of ultra boosting that can be done in the air, fire a core and dash at the same time, turn the camera 180 degrees, then malicious rail Checkpoint Ub/Chub Ultraboost, then checkpoint as you take damage from it, gives you momentum after respawning, this is significantly easier to do on 120 fps Frozen Unfriendly Pull-it/Fup Fire a rocket then whiplash it, fast explosion boost that can be done midair Floor Frozen Unfriendly Pull-it/Floor fup With freezeframe active while looking down, fire a rocket then whiplash it, launches straight up if not holding directional keys, otherwise launches in the direction you are moving Oil Sliding on oil perfectly preserves momentum Instant Rocket Ride Activate freezeframe shoot a rocket, jump, then slam, works while grounded or to swap to a new rocket Activate freezeframe, look very slightly down, then shoot and dash at the same time wait slightly then unfreeze, allows rocket riding quickly while mid air Core Snipe Boosts Fire a core eject in front of you, shoot it with the revolver then dash through it, you will get hit by the lasting hitbox and launched, the height of the core when you shoot it is very lenient Duck Boosting Shotgun primary fire pushes you forward slightly, can be used with shotgun swapping Biercer Holding left click while charging a piercer shot will fire it the instant it full charges</p><p>Combat Tech List: Shotgun Swapping Swapping between shotguns after each shot skips most of the cooldown Projectile Boost Punching with feedbacker as you fire the shotgun causes a pellet to explode on impact Nukes Firing a malicious rail at a core eject creates a very large high damage explosion Core Snipes Firing a revolver at a core eject creates a large red explosion Over Pump Dodge The blast from a fully charged green shotgun can be dodged Frozen Unfriendly Pull-it/Fup Whiplash a rocket then freeze it, you need to be in the air when the rocket reaches you, creates a large red explosion at the cost of 35 hp Flayer Instas Hitting a mindflayer with an explosion as it does the blue orbs attack will reflect the back at it, killing the mindflayer instantly, overpumps and nukes have a lasting explosion making the timing more lenient SRS Combo At point blank fire a cannonball then punch with feedbacker slightly after, quick high damage, one taps virtues, cerberi, and sentries. If you get the +CANNONBOOST style bonus, you punched too soon. You only need to charge srs cannon to 25% for full damage. Jackhammer whip cancel Whip canceling instantly grants max jackhammer damage Conduction in water Jumpstart and electric rail automatically trigger conduction while underwater with far greater range and self damage if you are touching the water Rocket Traps Placing a frozen rocket where an enemy spawns will create a large red explosion, this works whether or not the rocket has had time to supercharge due to enemies spawning slightly off and the ground Knuckleblast Cooldown Cancel Pressing swap arm or whiplash will cancel the cooldown from a knuckleblaster shockwave Overheat Quick Charge Firing one blue saw fully charges the heat on the green sawblade Coin Tech: Split coins Shooting a coin with the default revolver during the flash at the peak of its ark or after it has started making a humming sound while falling will cause it to turn into two hitscans, Coin Punching Punching a coin with the feedbacker at any point after the flash will send the coin into the nearest enemy or wherever you are facing and make it bounce back into the air with a damage increase, its damage caps after punching it into a surface 3 times Dead coins Shooting a coin and immediately after firing a new coin will transfer the damage to the new coin and increase it, allowing you to bypass the damage cap on coin punching Double Dead Coin Firing multiple coins then shooting and firing a new coin will transfer all the damage of the coins to the new one, this requires delaying firing the new coin slightly more than with only one coin Slab Coins Slab Piercer charge shot does incredibly high damage when shooting a coin Railcoins Throw a coin through an enemy then fire electric rail this will cause the rail to hit the enemy then chain of the coin to hit it again, quickly swapping back to the marksman allows adding more coins after the rail is shot Ricostacks If multiple hitscans hit a coin at the same time while in hitstop, they will both ricochet off the coin, the same applies to a hitscan and a feedbacker punch or whiplash, this will also allow reusing the coin Sludge</p><p>Types of Oobs/Skips: Untagged wall clip Certain walls are untagged and thus will not correct where the rocket launcher places you when mounting a rocket, allowing you to teleport through them, untagged walls can recognized by whiplashing them, if the whiplash passes through it, it is untagged Victoria Clip Certain walls, primarily in the violence layer are thinner, and don’t destroy frozen rockets that Are placed in them, getting on a rocket that is in this state will clip the camera out of bounds, from on the rocket looking down at about a 45 degree angle, then shooting a rocket, tapping whiplash and jump at the same time will clip you out Tight Space Clips Certain gaps in geometry that the player can’t normally fit through can be moved through by mounting a rocket Slide Clips Certain gaps in geometry that the player can’t normally fit through can be moved through by spamming slide, these clips are generally more consistent the higher your frame rate and the faster you mash slide Trigger Skip Some enemy spawn triggers are incredibly thin, and can be skipping by mounting a rocket that is placed precisely due to mounting a rocket teleporting you slightly Arch Clips Skuggle</p><p>Level Exits: CE Boost exit Core eject boost as the red door opens, place oil, slide jump, and slam Slam store exit Slam store off of the exit door, place oil, slide and turn sideways holding in the direction you are moving, then slam into the exit Ub exit Put your back to the exit door and ultraboost as the door opens, then quickly turn around and place oil, then slam into the exit or Stand slightly back from the door, as it opens flick ub, then place oil, then slam into the exit Sandwich exit Railless ub exit Dash Extension Exit</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div><footer class="vp-page-meta"><!----><div class="vp-meta-item git-info"><!----><!----></div></footer><!----><!--[--><!--]--></main><!--]--></div><!--[--><!----><!--]--><!--]--></div>
