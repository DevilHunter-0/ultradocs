        Land close to the center of the door and preform a <a href="/speedrun-tech#dives">Dive</a> towards the main building, aiming for breakable at the top of the roof.

        A short period after staring your dive, preform a <a href="/speedrun-tech#flick-ub">flick UB</a> aimed towards breakable. For potential additional speed, you can  <a href="/speedrun-tech#duck-boosting">duck boost</a> while flying towards breakable.

        Shoot breakable with any alternate varient of the pistol and slam into it.

        With the alternate Core Eject shotgun equipped, shoot and quickly after freeze rocket at the center of the door aimed within the higlighted yellow area pictured below:

    </p>
    <p>
        Move right all the way until up against the wall and shoot another rocket (while still frozen) aimed at the same level as the previous.
        Un-Freeze and Re-Freeze the rockets once they are close to the door, but there is still a slight gap. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Re-Center yourself to the door and with the Core Eject Jackhammer out, <b>hold</b> down primary fire and slide. Once you have pased the farthest rocket, do a 180 and preform a <a href="/speedrun-tech#jackhammer-ub">Jackhammer UB</a> on the two rockets.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once you have flow towards Breakable for a short period, preform a UB with the Jackhammer by looking opposite of the direction you want to go, shooting the core, and UBing. For potential additional speed, you can  <a href="/speedrun-tech#duck-boosting">duck boost</a> while flying towards breakable.
    </p>
    <p>
        Shoot breakable with any alternate varient of the pistol and slam into it.

        <b> 100 HP Variation </b>
        <p>
            Instead of instantly doing a regular UB for the second UB, you preform a <a href="/speedrun-tech#_35-hp-jackhammer-ub">35 HP Jackhammer UB</a>. This version of the start is recommended to only be used in FG catagories where you would play on a difficulty with 100 HP, as it is slightly slower than a regular UB.

        This start can only be preformed on harmless, and as such, it is recommended to only be used for <a href="/general-info#regular-terms">IL</a> speedruns.
    </div>
    <p>
        Put oil on the right wall and then aim first rocket towards the center of the black rectangle on the exit door. Shoot it and then freeze it right after,
        only allowing it move a short distance away from yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
        Move a bit to the right and place a second rocket slight diagonally down from the first while still frozen.
         Un-freeze and then Re-freeze the rockets when they are close to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
       <a href="/speedrun-tech#slam-storage">Slam store</a> off the right wall and use the wall jump from it to get to the left wall on top of the curb where the oil was placed.
       Slide towards the center of the door and 180 towards the rockets and preform a <a href="/speedrun-tech#jackhammer-ub">jackhammer UB</a> off the 2 rockets.

            Important
        </div>
        Make sure you continue to hold slide as you do the Jackhammer UB. This is to ensure that you are able to make it out of the entrance door without bonking it.
    </div>
    <br />
    <p>
       After a period of time, you will want to do your second UB. If your angle towards breakable is off angle, you can use this second UB to adjust your angle acordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's <b>not possible</b> to have a consistant time to do your second UB. This is due to factors such as angle, initial UB speed, and <a href="/speedrun-techtml#duck-boosting">duck boosting</a>. Deciding when to do your
        second UB will come down to intuition from playing the stage, and the amount you are willing to risk on Duck boost speed.
    </p>
    <p>
        During the period flying towards breakable, you can preform <a href="/speedrun-techtml#duck-boosting">duck boosting</a> for either potential additional horizantal speed, or, if you are too high above breakable,
        Duck boost downwards to slight move your position lower without loosing speed.
    </p>
    <p>
    Break breakable using a slab veriant of any pistol and slam into as early as possible.

            Tips

        If duck boosting, you will want to shoot breakable as late as possible to squeeze out as many potential duck boosts as possible
