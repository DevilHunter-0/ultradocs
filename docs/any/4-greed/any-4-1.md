    <p>
        Put oil on the right wall and then aim first rocket towards the center of the black rectangle on the exit door. Shoot it and then freeze it right after,
        only allowing it move a short distance away from yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
        Move a bit to the right and place a second rocket slight diagonally down from the first while still frozen.
         Un-freeze and then Re-freeze the rockets when they are close to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
       <a href="/speedrun-tech#slam-storage">Slam store</a> off the right wall and use the wall jump from it to get to the left wall on top of the curb where the oil was placed.
       Slide towards the center of the door and 180 towards the rockets and preform a <a href="/speedrun-tech#jackhammer-ub">jackhammer UB</a> off the 2 rockets.

            Important
        </div>
        Make sure you continue to hold slide as you do the Jackhammer UB. This is to ensure that you are able to make it out of the entrance door without bonking it.
    </div>
    <br />
    <p>
       After a period of time, you will want to do your second UB. If your angle towards breakable is off angle, you can use this second UB to adjust your angle acordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's <b>not possible</b> to have a consistant time to do your second UB. This is due to factors such as angle, initial UB speed, and <a href="/speedrun-techtml#duck-boosting">duck boosting</a>. Deciding when to do your
        second UB will come down to intuition from playing the stage, and the amount you are willing to risk on Duck boost speed.
    </p>
    <p>
        During the period flying towards breakable, you can preform <a href="/speedrun-techtml#duck-boosting">duck boosting</a> for either potential additional horizantal speed, or, if you are too high above breakable,
        Duck boost downwards to slight move your position lower without loosing speed.
    </p>
    <p>
    Break breakable using a slab veriant of any pistol and slam into as early as possible.

            Tips
        </div>
        If duck boosting, you will want to shoot breakable as late as possible to squeeze out as many potential duck boosts as possible
