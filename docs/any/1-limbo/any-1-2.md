Go around the middle of the arena and come close to the corner next to the door<br/>
You will be going through 2 triggers that are placed coming off of that corner, where you align yourself just like in the video and this is where you will perform the trigger skip <br/>
Look downwards at a 45° angle, shoot and then freeze a rocket in quick succession, slam down onto the rocket and you will have passed the triggers <br/>
Oil and dash slides will help you reach the shortcut tunnel as fast as possible and once you reach it dash to the power box and use jump start to open it
With this method the checkpoint is not necessary, so slam down and slide jump from there into the arena <br/>
