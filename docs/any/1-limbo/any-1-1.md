## [Untagged Wall Clip](https://youtu.be/ddrVnvt-kRI)
<font size="2">
    <b>Difficulty</b>: Slightly Easy (2/5)
</font>

[Slam Store](/speedrun-tech.md#slam-store) in the entrance pipe, slide jump, then [Slide Jump](/speedrun-tech.md#slide-jump) slightly to the right to curve around the cerberus statue. <br/>
Slide under the tree branch. <br/>
Place a frozen rocket against the wall between the fallen pillar and the door, facing straight down <br/>
Jump and slam to mount the rocket <br/>
Slam off the rocket, let yourself fall for a moment, then [Flick UB](/speedrun-tech.md#flick-ub) to the checkpoint <br/>


## [Arena Clear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu3sgrrz6Ic)
<font size="2">
    <b>Difficulty</b>: Easy (1/5)
</font>

[Dash jump](/speedrun-tech.md#dash-jump) then [Slide Jump](/speedrun-tech.md#slide-jump) to reach the arena<br/>
Place 3 magnets on the red door <br/>
Whiplash and jumpstart one of the strays, fire some nails into it, then knuckleblast it <br/>
Throw a few coins for additional conduction<br/>
Stand in the center of the room facing straight up, and [Nuke](/speedrun-tech.md#nukes) when the drones spawn <br/>
For reasons I canâ€™t explain, delaying the nuke slightly makes the nuke kill all the drones more consistently <br/>
