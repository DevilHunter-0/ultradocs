[Slam Store](/speedrun-tech.md#slam-store) in the entrance pipe, slide jump, then [Slide Jump](/speedrun-tech.md#slide-jump) slightly to the right to curve around the cerberus statue. <br/>
Slide under the tree branch. <br/>
Place a frozen rocket against the wall between the fallen pillar and the door, facing straight down <br/>
Jump and slam to mount the rocket <br/>
Slam off the rocket and [Flick UB](/speedrun-tech.md#flick-ub) to the checkpoint <br/>

Dash jump then [Slide Jump](/speedrun-tech.md#slide-jump) to reach the arena<br/>
Place 3 magnets on the red door <br/>
Whiplash and jumpstart one of the strays, fire some nails into it, then knuckleblast it <br/>
To make sure jumpstart kills everything, throw some extra coins <br/>
Stand in the center of the room facing straight up, and [Nuke](/speedrun-tech.md#nukes) when the drones spawn <br/>
For reasons I canâ€™t explain, delaying the nuke slightly makes the nuke kill all the drones more consistently <br/>
