You want to start your [slam store](/speedrun-tech.html#slam-store) right before the boss gibs. This may require some practice to get used to
::: note
This kill is somewhat inconsistent due to hideous mass weakpoints, if you are doing everthing and it isn't killing, you are probably not hitting weakpoint with either your sawtrap or railcoin
