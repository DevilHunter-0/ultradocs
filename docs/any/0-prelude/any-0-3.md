        For whatever reason, you <b>must</b> quickly swap to another weapon after hitting the Stray with the Jackhammer. Failing to do so will result in significantly less speed, roughly <i>70-80</i> hu/s rather than <i>160-180</i> hu/s.

        You must time your dash right so that you can slide under the door. If you have to slam or are too far from the door, you won't have a red guage on your jackhammer.

    For every SM kill listed here-- with the exception of <a href="#halakill">Halakill</a>-- you must charge your Oversaw by shooting at least one blue saw before you checkpoint. This is done after <a href="/speedrun-tech#ce-boost-core-eject-boost">CE boosting</a>, and you can see an example in the video for <a href="#glasspunch">Glasspunch</a>.

        Immediately after checkpointing, dash then <a href="/speedrun-tech#dash-jump">dash jump</a> through the door. <br />
        As soon as you get through the door, shoot your Oversaw and quickly swap to the Pump Charge shotgun. Pump it twice and shoot the Swordsmachine at the right time to <a href="/speedrun-tech#shotgun-parry">shotgun parry</a>.
    </p>
    <p>

        Swap to the Piercer alternate revolver. Begin charging it, then jump and punch the coin for a fourth time. <br />
        Slam down, look up, then shoot the coin through the SM's head with the <a href="/speedrun-tech#slab-coins">slabcoin</a>. <br />

        Prepunching
    </div>
    As you've seen in the previous two kills, punching the initial coin can be quite tricky, since you're going to unintentionally perform a <a href="/speedrun-tech#pboost-projectile-boost">projectile boost</a>, which may lead to the explosion pushing you or the coin away. <br />
    In order to fix this, you can do something called a <b>prepunch</b> (see video).
    <p>
        <video width="350" height="auto" loop controls muted>
            <source src="https://i.imgur.com/94lLgMU.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        </video>
    </p>
    For every kill that has an initial coin punch like this, right as the Swordsmachine spawns, you can jump, punch the coin, then slam. This makes the initial punch significantly more consistent, and prevents an accidental projectile boost, in exchange for being slightly more difficult. It's recommended to prepunch whenever applicable, as there's no reason not to. <br />
    <br />
    <i>(Every listed kill from now on will include prepunching.)</i>
