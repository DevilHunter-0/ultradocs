        For whatever reason, you <b>must</b> quickly swap to another weapon after hitting the Stray with the Jackhammer. Failing to do so will result in significantly less speed, roughly <i>70-80</i> hu/s rather than <i>160-180</i> hu/s.

        You must time your dash right so that you can slide under the door. If you have to slam or are too far from the door, you won't have a red gauge on your jackhammer.

    For every SM kill listed here-- with the exception of <a href="#halakill">Halakill</a>-- you must charge your Oversaw by shooting at least one blue saw before you checkpoint. This is done after <a href="/speedrun-tech#ce-boost-core-eject-boost">CE boosting</a>, and you can see an example in the video for <a href="#glasspunch">Glasspunch</a>.

        As you're punching the coin, pump the Pump Charge twice again.

        Punch the same coin again as you're falling down, then when you land jump and punch the coin a third time. Slam down and hit the SM with a point-blank shotgun shot.

        Prepunching
    </div>
    As you've seen in the previous two kills, punching the initial coin can be quite tricky, since you're going to unintentionally perform a <a href="/speedrun-tech#pboost-projectile-boost">projectile boost</a>, which may lead to the explosion pushing you or the coin away. <br />
    In order to fix this, you can do something called a <b>prepunch</b> (see video).
    <p>
        <video width="350" height="auto" loop controls muted>
            <source src="https://i.imgur.com/94lLgMU.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        </video>
    </p>
    For every kill that has an initial coin punch like this, right as the Swordsmachine spawns, you can jump, punch the coin, then slam. This makes the initial punch significantly more consistent, and prevents an accidental projectile boost, in exchange for being slightly more difficult. It's recommended to prepunch whenever applicable, as there's no reason not to. <br />
    <br />
    <i>(Every listed kill from now on will include prepunching.)</i>

Instead of instantly shooting the coin at the end you wait a little bit, aim, and then make sure you <b> SHOOT THE COIN. </b> the timing is odd but it can get consistent with practice. 

Use style meter to check if you are doing it correctly. It should say <b>ULTRA</b>ricoshot x15 twice and <b>ULTRA</b>ricoshot x14 once. (See video to check)
