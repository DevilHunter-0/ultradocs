</font>

[CE Boost](/speedrun-tech.md#ce-boost-core-eject-boost) through red doors as they open, slam when you reach the door, dash slide through, then [CE Boost](/speedrun-tech.md#ce-boost-core-eject-boost) over the lava, when you land, [Slide Jump](/speedrun-tech.md#slide-jump) and wait until the boss door starts to open before checkpointing so that the boss will do the fast spawn animation

<font size="2">
    <b>Difficulty</b>: Intermediate (3/5)
</font>

[Slam Store](/speedrun-tech.md#slam-store) in the red room hallway and slide, using [Slideways](/speedrun-tech.md#slideways) for extra speed <br/>
[UB](/speedrun-tech.md#ub-ultraboost) to bonk onto the ceiling and then perfectly go straight into the door <br/>
When you land [Slide Jump](/speedrun-tech.md#slide-jump) and wait until the boss door starts to open before checkpointing so that the boss will do the fast spawn animation <br/>
For the ub, stand in line with the red line in the image and look where shown, you also want to be on the half of the platform closer to the wall you are aiming at <br/>
You can hold left or right to adjust slightly to make sure you land at the door <br/>

## Boss Kill

### [Simple Variation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB-7rGVHKnU)
<font size="2">
    <b>Difficulty</b>: Slightly Easy (2/5)
</font>

[DSJ](/speedrun-tech.md#dsj-dash-slide-jump) into the room, place a saw trap with 8 blue saws and an overheat saw, using multiple magnets so it hits where both Cerberi will spawn. <br/>
First Cerberus: <br/>
Jumpstart, then charge up and shoot the alt fire on the slab sharpshooter. Fire a rocket then charge red jackhammer primary and alt fire. [Whip Cancel](/speedrun-tech.md#whip-cancel) to the Cerberus and release both primary and alt fire. If the Cerberus’s first attack is a dash you will have to dash to the side first in order to whip cancel to it. <br/>
[Cerb Dash Version](https://youtu.be/oB-7rGVHKnU) <br/>
Second Cerberus:<br/>
[Railcoin](/speedrun-tech.md#railcoins) it with 1 coin then [S.R.S. Combo](/speedrun-tech.md#srs-combo)<br/>
Exit: During hitstop from the second Cerberus dying start charging the green shotgun. Count four pumps, then [Slam Store](/speedrun-tech.md#slam-store) on the door and [Dive](/speedrun-tech.md#dives), then look down and over pump. Slam once near the exit, put oil on the ground and slide into the exit, use [Slideways](/speedrun-tech.md#slideways) for extra speed. Ideally you want to slam on the stairs and not the flat part of the ground.<br/>

### [Intermediate Variation](https://youtu.be/KGV218RLHEo)
<font size="2">
    <b>Difficulty</b>: Intermediate (3/5)
</font>

[DSJ](/speedrun-tech.md#dsj-dash-slide-jump) into the room, place a saw trap with 8 blue saws and an overheat saw that can hit where the first Cerberus spawns <br/>
First Cerberus: <br/>
Equip red jackhammer, go near where the second Cerberus spawns, charge the primary and secondary fire on the jackhammer. Time a dash jump toward the first Cerberus to hit it with the jackhammer as soon as it is vulnerable. During the jackhammer hitstop, jumpstart Cerberus. This should reduce it down to less than half HP, triggering the second Cerberus spawn. <br/>
Second Cerberus: <br/>
Once you’re out of hitstop, start placing frozen rockets on top of where the second Cerberus will spawn and parry the first Cerberus’s apple throw. After placing 3 rockets the second Cerberus will spawn, [S.R.S. Combo](/speedrun-tech.md#srs-combo) it as soon as it spawns and aim it so it will hit the first Cerberus to make sure it dies. <br/>
Note: If your rockets are exploding while you are trying to parry, stop placing rockets, parry, then continue placing rockets. <br/>

### [Harder Intermediate Variation](https://youtu.be/KGV218RLHEo&t=13s)
<font size="2">
    <b>Difficulty</b>: Slightly Hard (4/5)
</font>

Similar to the Intermediate variation, however, once you’ve placed all your saws, freeze and place a rocket where the second cerberus would spawn, then quickly swap to jackhammer and proceed with the intermediate kill, except with 4 rockets instead of 3. Once you’ve placed your 4 rockets, dismount them and then [S.R.S. Combo](/speedrun-tech.md#srs-combo) the first cerb so it dies, then once the second cerb dies it should be instantly killed because of the 4 rockets.
