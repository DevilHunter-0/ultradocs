        Start off by doing a <a href="/speedrun-tech#ub-ultraboost">UB (Ultraboost)</a> after clipping out updoor, making <b>sure</b> your direction is going near / towards the arena..
    </p>
    <p>
        Once you're <b>near</b> (too close and it loads in with you in it) the door, slam down into the tiny area shown below, as this is required to load the exit from out-of-bound.
