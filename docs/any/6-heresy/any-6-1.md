     Start off by firing saws from the overheat sawblade launcher to heat the alternate fire and continue firing until the overheat saw is used, then perform a <a href="/speedrun-tech#slam-store">Slam Store</a> in the hallway of the starting room and slide. When you land <a href="/speedrun-tech#slide-jump">Slide Jump</a> then fire the overheat saw as you go through the door into the first arena so that it bounces between the two doors. Then slide when you land to start the arena.
     <p>
      </p>
      Start charging an overpump and position yourself centered between the two malicious faces and directly in front of the swordsmachine. Parry the swordsmachine, then look down. Wait until one of the malicious face orbs hit you, then fire the overpump. The inviciblility from getting hit will prevent the overpump from damaging you and the explosion will reflect the orbs back, killing both malicious faces.
      <p>
      </p>
      Stand against the door and to the side, slam after the shockwave bounces you, then <a href="/speedrun-tech#dash-jump">Dash Jump</a>, then slide jump to get to the top of the stairs. Turn right and stand against the wall, activate freezeframe and jump. Place a frozen rocket at the peak of your jump so that it is partially in the ceiling, then move to the wall behind you and <a href="/speedrun-tech#dives">Dive</a>, holding the slide input. If done correctly landing on the rocket will clip you out of bounds. 
      <p>
      </p>
      Turn right and <a href="/speedrun-tech#flick-ub">Flick UB</a> towards the checkpoint, once you are lower down than the checkpoint, <a href="/speedrun-tech#instant-rocket-ride">Instant Rocket Ride</a> to reach it.

The angle you throw the coins at is important, you want the coins to be at about the same  height as the hideous mass's weakpoint or it might miss the weakpoint and not kill <br/>
You can fire the piercer slightly before the hideous mass spawns due to hitscans taking time to pass between coins <br/>
